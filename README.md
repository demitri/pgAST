# pgAST

### The Starlink AST library as a PostgreSQL plug-in.

Author: Demitri Muna

pgAST is a PostgreSQL plug-in that implements some functionality from the [Starlink AST](https://github.com/Starlink/ast), a library for handling world coordinate systems (WCS) in astronomy. This plug-in provides an interface between WCS and region-related functionality and data available in databases containing astronomical data. Rather than pull data down to a client to perform astronomy-related calculations, these can be performed at the server to reduce the need of transferring data and provide more application-specific filters in queries.

Only a few functions are currently defined; more will be added over time. This project provides a straightforward means of extending the functionality of the powerful and well-tested AST library into a database.

## Building and Installing the Extension

Building pgAST requires the [Starlink AST Library](https://github.com/Starlink/ast) to be installed. Note the path where this is installed to use for the `make` command (i.e. replace `/usr/local/ast` below with your location).

From top level of PgAST directory:

```bash
make clean; make AST=/usr/local/ast
sudo make install
```

Then from `psql`:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION pgast;
CREATE EXTENSION pgast;
```

## Documentation & API

### Data Types
Note that many of these functions accept and return native PostgreSQL geometric types (i.e. *not* PostGIS), such as [Circles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-geometric.html#DATATYPE-CIRCLE), [Polygons](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-geometric.html#DATATYPE-POLYGON), and [Points](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-geometric.html#id-1.5.7.16.5). A reference of geometric functions supported by the database for use with these objects can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-geometry.html).

All geometries are on the celestial sphere and in the ICRS coordinate frame unless otherwise noted. Points of a polygon are connected by great circle segments.

### API

The functions defined by this extension are:

```sql
pgast_bounding_circle(polygon poly)
pgast_bounding_circle(text fits_header_as_string)
pgast_bounding_polygon(text fits_header_as_string)
pgast_point_in_polygon(float8 ra, float8 dec, polygon poly)
pgast_point_in_polygon(float8 ra, float8 dec, text fits_header_string)
pgast_icrs_polygon_overlaps_hdu(polygon icrs_polygon, text fits_header_as_string)
```


### `pgast_bounding_circle`

##### Returns the minimum bounding circle of a 2D image or a polygon.

This function has two signatures; it accepts a `text` value of a FITS header or a PostgreSQL Polygon object.

```sql
pgast_bounding_circle(polygon)
pgast_bounding_circle(fits_header_as_string)
```

The return value is a native PostgreSQL Circle record.

The FITS header must be provided as a single string, i.e. each 80 character record concatenated. Only the header records that define the WCS and pixel dimensions of the image are necessary, but it's usually easier to pass in the full header. The header as a string can be stored in the database in another column or concatenated using another function. The circle center point is defined as (ra,dec) and the radius is in degrees.

Values of the circle can be read as:

```sql
-- radius in degrees
SELECT RADIUS(pgast_bounding_circle(fits_header_as_string)) FROM ...
```

```sql
-- return the center of the circle (Point object) as ra,dec
SELECT POINT(pgast_bounding_circle(fits_header_as_string)) FROM ...
```

### `pgast_bounding_polygon`

##### Return a polygon that describes the perimeter of a 2D FITS image.

The return value is a native PostgreSQL Polygon record.

```sql
pgast_bounding_polygon(text fits_header_as_string)
```

### `pgast_point_in_polygon`

##### Test whether an (ra,dec) point is within a given polygon.

Returns `true` or `false`. The function comes in two forms. The first takes the ra,dec point along with a PostgreSQL polygon:

```sql
pgast_point_in_polygon(float8 ra, float8 dec, polygon poly)
```

The second takes the full FITS header as a single string and extracts a polygon (if it can) from that:

```sql
pgast_point_in_polygon(float8 ra, float8 dec, text fits_header_string)
```


### `pgast_icrs_polygon_overlaps_hdu`

##### Test whether two polygons on the sky overlap.

This function takes a PostgreSQL polygon, assumed to be in the ICRS coordinate system in degrees, and compares it to a polygon derived from the FITS header of a 2D image HDU. The FITS header provided is not required to also be in the ICRS coordinate system â€” the underlying AST code will perform any necessary transformation.

`NULL` is returned if the FITS header is not of a 2D image with axis lengths at least 2, or if a WCS cannot be read from the header.

```sql
pgast_icrs_polygon_overlaps_hdu(polygon icrs_polygon, text fits_header_as_string)
```

## Developer Notes

This section is intended for those who are interested in working with the source code.

### Debugging

Log messages can be placed in the C code. Each message should specify a log level, one of:

```
DEBUG5, DEBUG4, DEBUG3, DEBUG2, DEBUG1,
LOG, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR
```

These are in descending order of verbosity. Use the `ereport` function to send a log message, specifying the log level (first parameter):

```c
ereport(NOTICE, (errmsg("Log message here.")));
```
This above is an abbreviated version of the more verbose method, which specifies an error code:

```c
ereport(NOTICE,
	    (
	     errcode(ERRCODE_ARRAY_ELEMENT_ERROR),
		 (errmsg("Header:\n"))
		)
		);
```

And for an even longer version:

```c
ereport(ERROR,
            (
             errcode(ERRCODE_NUMERIC_VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE),
             errmsg("negative values are not allowed"),
             errdetail("value %d is negative", arg),
             errhint("make it positive")
            )
        );
```

See [this blog post](http://big-elephants.com/2015-10/writing-postgres-extensions-part-iii/) for more detail.

The settings in `postgresql.conf` determines which level of log messages are sent to the client and/or the server log. The details can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHEN).

For example, to view `DEBUG1` messages and higher (less verbose) in the client (e.g. `psql`), place this line in `postgresql.conf` and restart the server:

```
set client_min_messages = debug1
```

or to see messages in just the client session:

```sql
SET client_min_messages TO 'DEBUG1';
```
